## Location
We are going to be in the hotel, night and day. That is why, we have chosen the [Hotel Continental](https://www.hotelcontinentalrimini.it/) in Rimini as our location for the unconference.

Since one of the important aspects of SoCraTes is being close to the “action”, everything will happen within
the location: lodging, eating and mingling. As a result, we can only accept as many participants as the
number of available beds.

## What will I pay for?
You will pay the cost of:

You will pay your part at the checkout.<br /><br />
* **2 nights full-board + the city tax**:<br /> the hotel has both twin or double rooms. If there is someone you
are willing to share the room with, please let us know when you register. If you don’t know anyone,
don’t worry: we will do our best to find you a suitable roommate ;-)
