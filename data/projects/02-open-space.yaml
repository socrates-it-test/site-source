    SoCraTes IT will be run as a three days Open Space, facilitated by the outstanding facilitator <a href="https://connexxo.com/">Cecilia Alimenti</a>. 
    We love working in self-organizing teams - well, Open Space is a simple technique for creating a self-organizing conference!

    It runs on ''four principles and one law" and it has been used by thousands of people around the globe since then:

    * Whoever comes is the right people
    * Whenever it starts is the right time
    * Whatever happens is the only thing that could have
    * When it’s over it’s over

    ### The Law Of Two Feet

    "If at any time you find that you are neither learning nor contributing, use you two feet and move to some place more to you liking."

    Such a place might be another group, or even outside into the sunshine. No matter what, don't sit there feeling miserable. It's your conference, and you're in charge of it.
    
    In OpenSpace there are no leaders, no followers, definitely no talking-heads - only participants. Does this sound strange to you? Come prepared to create the event you need - starting with collaboratively building our agenda, full of topics we have passion for.

    Don't worry how this will work - just show up with your passion and Prepare To Be Surprised!
