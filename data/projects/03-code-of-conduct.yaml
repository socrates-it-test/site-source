    SoCraTes IT follows the Conference Code of Conduct laid out by several conference organisers around the globe. We ask that you read the full version before attending. You are required to cooperate with the code throughout the event to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

    Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.

    ### Scope
    This code of conduct applies to the SoCraTes conference itself and to all digital spaces that are related to the SoCraTes conference, such as the wiki and mailing list.
