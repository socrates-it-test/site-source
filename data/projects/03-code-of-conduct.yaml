    The conference starts Thursday at 17h00 and ends Sunday at 16h00.

    The rooms at the castle are available at 16h00 on Thursday.

    ## Format

    The event will be run as a two day [Open Space](http://agilecoachcamp.org/tiki-index.php?page=OpenSpace).

    Open Space means there is no agenda, or rather: you set the agenda. This is your time, make the best of it! For ideas about what you can do in advance have a look at this article.

    Facilitation will be in English. However, it will be possible to run sessions in other languages.
    Evening activities

    Participants organize evening activities. In other events like this one there were a multitude of things going on in the evenings, from music, over board games to live-hacking programs. And of course thereâ€™s always plenty of people to just talk to, or continue discussions from the day.
